Harmonizer
==========

Simple school project. The purpose of this web app is to record a milling machine, and send the recorded audio - as well as other information - for analysis. The information is sent as a text file in json format, to a predefined email address together with the two audio files.

The idea is that a server does the heavy lifting of analysing the audio-data, and the mobile web app provides an easy-to-use interface for recording and uploading the data.

PHP 5.5 Server
